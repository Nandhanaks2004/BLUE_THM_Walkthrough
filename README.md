# Blue — TryHackMe Walkthrough (EternalBlue)

**Short description**  
TryHackMe Blue (EternalBlue / MS17-010) — a short, beginner-friendly walkthrough documenting recon → exploit → post-exploit → hash cracking → flags, created as part of pentesting practice and learning.

---

## Objective
- Demonstrate a full exploit chain for MS17-010 (EternalBlue) in a controlled lab environment.  
- Practice essential red-team skills: service recon, Metasploit exploitation, meterpreter post-exploitation, process migration, hash dumping and offline cracking.  
- Capture the three room flags to validate successful exploitation and post-exploitation.

## Why I did this (learning goals)
This walkthrough is part of my hands-on pentesting learning path. I enjoy:
- Turning theoretical vulnerabilities into practical, repeatable lab exercises.  
- Practicing reconnaissance and deciding which tools and options to use.  
- Learning Metasploit workflows and meterpreter post-exploitation techniques.  
- Improving my ability to think like an attacker while keeping ethics and safety top of mind.  
- Building concise, reusable walkthroughs that help other beginners learn faster.
